## Acknowledgments

This codebase is built upon and inspired by two primary sources:

- [**Diff-Mix**](https://github.com/Zhicaiwww/Diff-Mix): Enhance Image Classification via Inter-class Image Mixup with Diffusion Model.
- [**SwiftBrush v2**](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/SwiftBrushV2):  Make Your One-step Diffusion Model Better Than Its Teacher.

We gratefully acknowledge the authors of these works for their contributions, which laid the foundation for DasDiff. This project adapts their techniques with a focus on rare species classification under low-shot settings.
